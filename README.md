## Tips for Effective Usage

### Workflow Recommendations
1. Use `<Space><Space>` for quick file access
2. Use `<leader>p` to quickly preview git changes
3. Use `]c` and `[c` to navigate through git changes
4. Use `<leader>ft` to search for text across your project
5. Use `<S-l>` and `<S-h>` to switch between open files

### Git Workflow
1. Navigate to changed lines with `]c`/`[c`
2. Preview changes with `<leader>p`
3. Stage individual hunks with `<leader>gs`
4. Stage entire file with `<leader>gS`

### File Management
1. Open file explorer with `<Space>e`
2. Use Telescope for fuzzy finding: `<leader>ff`
3. Switch between buffers: `<S-l>`/`<S-h>`
4. Search across files: `<leader>ft`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- If gitsigns shortcuts don't work, ensure you're in a git repository
- If Telescope is slow, it may be indexing large directories
- File explorer icons require a nerd font for proper display

### Performance
- Configuration optimized for smooth resizing
- Large files (>5000 lines) have reduced git integration
- Syntax highlighting limited to first 200 characters per line

## Customization
The configuration is modular and located in:
- `lua/core/options.lua` - Vim options
- `lua/core/keymaps.lua` - Key mappings
- `lua/core/plugins.lua` - Plugin definitions
- `lua/core/plugin_config/` - Individual plugin configurations

Feel free to modify any settings to match your workflow preferences!
